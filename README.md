#Neural Style Transfer

Creating artistic images via neural style transfer.


This project is based on the idea presented by Gatys et al. in the paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style". https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576

The code is based on the neural style transfer example given in the Keras documentation.

Below are some examples of images created using this code.
